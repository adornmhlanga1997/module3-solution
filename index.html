        <p> The economic climate of these countries prevented them from establishing industries sooner, however, widespread piracyal lowed consumers to participate, which in turn led to the growth of game development in their countries. This suggests a soft link between the size of the consumer market of a development industry. Early pioneers in the game development industry were primarily motivated by passion rather than gain or viability. Growth has been stifled to a degree by a lack of access to local high-level skills resulting in the need to import skills from other jurisdictions, as it is cheaper to import skills than to upskill the local talent/own workforce.

The Gap Analysis focused on these indicators and tried to determine how well the current South African Ecosystem measures up in terms of these indicators and investigated potential actions that could be taken to improve on hem. Additionally, research was conducted on the role of game development for mobile platforms could hold for the industry as well as any challenges that local developers may face.
